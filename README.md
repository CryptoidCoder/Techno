# Techno


## Prerequests:
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## How To Format `.env` file:
- Create a file called `.env`
- In it should be the following:

- In between the ' ' you need to add your own token
- You do not need the text or the ''
```

Master = 'your name here / what you want Techno to call you'
WakeWord = 'a word to trigger the query taking / what you want to call it'


```

### To Do Thing1:
- `python file1.py --arg1:thing --arg2:thing1/thing2`
- You need to have `--arg1:` or `--arg2:` before an argument
- The first argument is to *do this thing*
- If you use `thing1` for your second argument - it will do `thing1`
- If you use `thing2` for your second argument - it will do `thing2`



## Future:
[Read this TODO File to see what I plan to do in the future](TODO)
In future this will run on a raspberry pi - and use its LED's & GPIO's
It will require a microphone & speaker for this.
